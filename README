A very simple "Hello World" web application using Play (https://www.playframework.com/) in Scala.

This web application includes a `manifest.yml`to deploy it in IBM Bluemix Cloud. The manifest looks as follows:

```
applications:
- memory: 256M
  instances: 1
  name: scala-helloworld
  disk_quota: 1024M
  buildpack: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-scala.git
```

== Usage ==

1. Start the application using "run"
2. Two endpoints:

GET: "curl -X GET localhost:9000/hello-world"
PUT: "curl -X PUT localhost:9000/hello-world?value=Hello"
